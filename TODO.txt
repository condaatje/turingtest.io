Essential:
================================
Stochasticity in responses
    - randomly choose from responses weighted on percent success.

NLP
    - Then move into smarter vectorization for conversations (if possible)
        - Questions are not independent, conversations flow.

Time delay between question and response (could be another feature in the vector)

Comment the crap out of it/super cleanup & abstraction.



Not essential for Final Project scope:
================================
sentence n-grams for conversation model?

Neural Net? Incorporate past few questions in conversation, not just independent

Random aliases for Alan

Rooms not based on name. Base on unique socket ID.

deal with "asdjlkfha;as;dfa;kljsdfhaksd"
    - right now Alan doesn't think it's similar to "asdfk;jah;dfkal;sdfasdf"

Clean up system - multi-server w/ dns-level apps for api etc.

Https?

Load balancer

Group Chat? This should at least be in the whitepaper/final paper
    - Interesting to see how an AI could take part in a group conversation
    - Punish if singled out, like "/machine Alan"
