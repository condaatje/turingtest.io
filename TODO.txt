Feature-complete chat (right now it's user-trusting)
    - Sessions
    - Usernames?


Connect chat to model (Frontend -> node/socket -> Django ttioAPI -> socket emit)
    Should be a simple interface: post string from node server to ttio API server
    âˆš connected chat to django and back again. Still don't have a model lol.


Model (the big deal)
    - All the ML stuff
    - Neural Net
    - 'Eavesdropping' learning method

Https?
Bootstrap UI
