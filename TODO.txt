Essential:
================================
Model (the big deal)
    - Neural Net?
    - 'Eavesdropping' learning method

NLP
    - Then move into smarter vectorization for sentences
        - Similar questions share response model
    - Then move into smarter vectorization for conversations (if possible)
        - Questions are not independent, conversations flow.

Time delay between question and response (could be another feature in the vector)

Matchmaker

Comment the crap out of it/super cleanup & abstraction.




Not essential for Final Project scope:
================================
Clean up system - multi-server w/ dns-level apps for api etc.

Https?

Load balancer

Group Chat? This should at least be in the whitepaper/final paper
    - Interesting to see how an AI could take part in a group conversation
