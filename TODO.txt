Essential:
================================
Model (the big deal)
    - All the ML stuff
    - Neural Net
    - 'Eavesdropping' learning method

Training:
    - When someone guesses 'machine' correctly, punish.
        - Guesses 'man,' reward. Will use 

Explore vs. Exploit:
    - Add some stochasticity in responses/behavior to make sure we're always learning

NLP
    - Going to start without any vectorization:
        - Each new sentence/question has its own response
        - "What's up?" is different from "What is up?"
        - 'dumb' conversation model: every question is a new 'conversation'
    - Then move into smarter vectorization for sentences
        - Similar questions share response model
    - Then move into smarter vectorization for conversations (if possible)
        - Questions are not independent, conversations flow.
        



Not essential for Final Project scope:
================================
Clean up system - multi-server w/ dns-level apps for api etc.

Feature-complete chat (right now it's user-trusting)
    - Sessions
    - Usernames?
